# CVG Substrate

## Ingredients
- **Coco Coir** - 650g brick
- **Vermiculite** - 8 cups
- **Gypsum** - 1 cup
- **Water** - 18 cups

Avoid anything intended for gardening as these are often deliberately contaminated with
trichoderma and treated with salt. Instead, use coir intended for reptiles as these are free from both these potential issues. Brands such as Eco Earth and Coco Bliss are recommended. Similarly, ensure gypsum is mycological grade.

- **Power Drill with Mud Mixing Bit** (Optional)

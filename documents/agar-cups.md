# Making Agar Cups

## Ingredients
- **Light Malt Extract (LME)** - 15 grams
- **Agar Agar Powder** - 10 grams
- **Food Coloring**
- **Water** - 500ml

## Supplies
- **Quart Mason Jar w/ Lid and Ring** (Wide Mouth)
- **2oz Snack Cups w/ Lids** - 50
- **Aluminum Foil**
- **Instant Read Thermometer**
- **Still Air Box**, **Glove box**, or **Flow Hood**
- **Pressure Cooker**
- **Magnetic Stir Bar** (Optional)
- **Magnetic Stirrer** (Optional)

## Directions
1. Heat **Water** and transfer to **Quart Mason Jar**.
1. Add **LME**, **Agar Agar Powder**, and as much **Food Coloring** as desired, then stir.
1. Add **Magnetic Stir Bar** to **Quart Mason Jar** and loosely fit **Lid and Ring**. Cover lid with **Aluminum Foil**.
1. Transfer **Quart Mason Jar** to **Pressure Cooker**. Following the manufacturers directions, bring **Pressure Cooker** to 15PSI and hold for 45 minutes.
1. Remove **Pressure Cooker** from heat and allow time for pressure to drop to 0 PSI.
1. Remove **Quart Mason Jar** from **Pressure Cooker** and allow time to cool to 115F.
    - Ensure mixture is periodically mixed while dropping to or holding at 115F, otherwise it will begin to
congeal. This is best done using a **Magnetic Stirrer** but can also be done by manually rotating the **Quart Mason Jar**.
    - Measure temperature from the external surface of the jar using an **Instant Read Thermometer**. Do not insert thermometer into agar mixture as this will risk contamination.
1. Move the **Quart Mason Jar** and **2oz Snack Cups w/ Lids** to **Still Air Box**, **Glove box**, or **Flow Hood** in prepartion for pouring. If using a **Still Air Box** or **Glove Box**, allow 10 minutes for air to settle before moving onto the next step.
1. One snack cup at a time, fill approximately 1/4 full (1/2oz), then seal with lid.
    - Stack these at least 5 tall. This helps lids be clear of condensation after cooling
1. Allow cups to cool before moving.
1. Allow 4 - 5 days to determine if any cups have contamination. Toss those.

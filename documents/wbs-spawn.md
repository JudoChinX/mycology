# WBS (Wild Bird Seed) Grain Spawn

## Ingredients
- **WBS (Wild Bird Seed)**
- **Water**

## Supplies
- **Quart Mason Jar w/ Lid and Ring** (Wide Mouth)
- **Mason Jar Lids w/ Self Healing Injection Ports and Filter Stickers** (Wide Mouth)
- **Aluminum Foil**
- **Stock Pot**
- **Stirring Spoon**
- **Strainer**
- **Pressure Cooker**

## Directions

### Part 1
1. Place **strainer** in sink.
1. Fill **stock pot** with as much **WBS** as youâ€™d like to prepare.
1. In stock pot, cover **WBS** with water, and stir.
    - While you stir, water will become dirty. Pour off as much excess water as possible into strainer without losing seed, and fill again.
    - Use **slotted spoon** to strain off and remove floaters. These will typically be sunflower seed shells.
    - Repeat this until water covering **WBS** is clear, 2 - 3 times.
1. Allow WBS to soak for 12 - 24 hours.

### Part 2
1. Rinse WBS one additional time and cover with water in stock pot.
1. Bring to a simmer and immediately remove from heat.
1. Strain WBS in sink by pouring into strainer, and allow to drain.
    - Depending on volume of **WBS** being prepared, this may need to be done in several stages.
1. Cover table with aluminum foil.
1. Spread strained, still hot **WBS** onto **aluminum foil** and allow to dry.
    - **WBS** can be considered dry once seed placed on a paper towel no longer leaves moisture marks.
    - This can be sped up using a fan.
1. Fill **mason jars** 80% full with prepared **WBS**.
1. Loosely fit each **mason jar** with **lid w/ self healing injection ports and filter stickers**.
1. Cover each **mason jar lid** with **aluminum foil**.
1. Pressure cook at 15 PSI for 120 minutes.
1. Once **pressure cooker has cooled**, tighten each **lid**, then remove **foil.**
1. Once **jars** have cooled, shake each jar to redistribute moisture and prevent clumping.
1. Allow 24 hours for moisture to redistribute before innoculation.

# Liquid Culture (Advanced)

## Ingredients
- **Sorghum Syrup** - 42 grams
- **Bovine Peptone** - 2.5 grams
- **Light Malt Extract (LME)** - 4 grams
- **Distilled Water** - 1500ml

## Supplies
- **Wide Mouth Mason Jars w/ Rings**
- **Wide Mouth Mason Jar Lids with Self Healing Injection Ports and Sticker Filters**
- **Magnetic Stir Bar** (1x per jar)
- **Magnetic Stirrir**
- **Aluminum Foil**
- **Pot to Boil Water**
- **Pressure Cooker**

## Directions
1. Bring **Distilled Water** to a boil.
1. Add **Sorghum Syrup**, **Bovine Peptone**, and **Light Malt Extract (LME)** and stir thoroughly.
1. Divide mixture between **Wide Mouth Mason Jars**.
1. Add one **Magnetic Stir Bar** per jar.
1. Top jars with **Wide Mouth Mason Jar Lids with Self Healing Injection Ports and Sticker Filters**, then loosely secure with **Ring**. **Rings** should be screwed on, but able wiggle back and forth. The goal is to ensure that as the mixture in each jar boils, steam can escape without having to travel through the filter patch.
1. Cover each lid with **Aluminum Foil**.
1. Pressure cook at 15 PSI for 45 minutes.
1. Once cool, tighten the **Rings** on each jar, then remove the **Aluminum Foil**. Your liquid culture base is now ready for inoculation.
